### sarek.pathfindr
### Scoring and ranking somatic and germline variations for cancer research

Original code is at https://github.com/NBISweden/pathfindr developed by Markus Mayrhofer. Still in progress, but it can have some use. It is intended to run on data generated by [Sarek](https://nf-co.re/sarek), and the goal is to
get filtered, ranked somatic and germline variants, optionally in a HTML page, or in an annotated VCF.

To run the code you have to 
  - run Sarek for a normal/tumor sample, get variant calls for ASCAT, Control-FREEC, HaplotypeCaller (calls for both the normal and the tumor sample), Mutect4 (GATK 3.8 for the moment), Strelka and Manta in somatic mode.
  - clone this repo
  - install the required R packages
  - edit pathfindr.config.yaml
  - run runPathfindr.R
